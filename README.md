# Notepad

This is a simple notepad app that I first published around November 24, 2020 to [Replit](https://replit.com). You could originally access it at [notepad.bd103.repl.co](https://notepad.bd103.repl.co). Due to certain changes in Replit's hosting services, it is no longer possible to host a static website such as this for free. I decided to re-upload the project here, since Replit is no longer a dependable service. A year ago I switched to local development with VSCode, and have never looked back.

This website has some flaws, but it holds a special place in my heart because it was one of the first projects I frequently used. I hope you take some inspiration from one of my earliest projects!
